# PrecisionLender Technical Screening
Please complete all 3 questions using C#. You may use any .NET libraries or NuGet packages that you choose, but please provide an explanation why for each.

## #1: Unit Testing
Write a method that accepts two strings and produces an interleaved result composed of alternating letters from each source string. Example, given "abc" and "123", the result would be "a1b2c3". Then, write unit tests for the method. In comments, explain your design and testing decisions.

## #2: REST API Testing
Recipe Puppy is a nifty search engine that finds recipes based on ingredients. They provide a simple API at http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/. Write a set of automated test cases to test its API calls. Explain (a) why you chose the test coverage you did and (b) how the solution could be extended/improved in the future. Include a screen shot of passing test results.

## #3: Web UI Testing
Recipe Puppy also has as Web UI for their search engine: http://www.recipepuppy.com/. Write a set of automated test cases to test the search features of the Web UI. Again, explain (a) why you chose the test coverage you did and (b) how the solution could be extended/improved in the future. Include a screen shot of passing test results.
